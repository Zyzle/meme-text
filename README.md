# @zyzle/meme-text

I got fed up with all the spongebob/cursed(zalgo) text generators online being riddled with adverts so made my own. If anyone else wants to use it feel free, maybe give a tag back to the npm page or GitHub repo if you like it :D

## This curse is too powerful!

If you're seeing a bunch of question marks or boxes (or question marks in boxes!) in your HTML after using `curse` you're probably just using a font that doesn't have the necessary diacritic symbols. I recommend `font-family: "Arial, sans-serif";` as Arial seems to have everything supported and is available by default for most browsers.

I also don't recommend pushing the curse level above 10 if you still want the base text to be legible.
